##Overview

Natural language processing often aims to disambiguate text. But, not all text thrives on clarity. For example, poetry often relies on the ambiguity of words to create figurative relationships with rich imagery. The work here is preliminary and exploratory in nature and seeks to contribute to the usage of natural language processing tools in more creative tasks, such as poetry. We start with a constrained problem - sonnet generation.

This paper describes the automatic creation of four line sonnet stanzas. Initially, a word is randomly selected from a rhyme bank to end the first line. Then, the first line is generated backwards using a trigram language model trained on existing sonnets. The process is repeated for subsequent lines using end words that fulfill the target rhyme scheme (a-b-a-b for Shakespearean or a-b-b-a for Petrarchan). In creating the rhyme bank, two approaches were considered: one to infer rhymes given a partial tagging of rhymes based on phonemes <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a> and the other using an expectation maximization learning algorithm to extract rhyme relationships irrespective of phonemes. 

This work relies on many of the insights and methodologies from previous research on computational poetry analysis and computational poetry generation. 

Work on computational poetry analysis includes McCurdy et al.’s identification of rhyme types in poetry <a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a>,  which uses phonemes supplemented with automated techniques including letter to sound rules as proposed by Black et al. and syllable segmentation methods using Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models as proposed by Bartlett et al. <a href="#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">[5]</a>     Reddy, S. and Knight, K. use an expectation maximization learning algorithm to extract rhymes from the ending words of sonnet lines without prior knowledge of word phonemes<a href="#fn6" id="ref6">[6]</a>.  Addanki, K. and Wu, D. extended Reddy and Knight’s work to hip hop lyrics using Hidden Markov Models to identify rhyming words in hip hop lines. <a href="#fn7" id="ref7">[7]</a>

In their computational poetry generation work, Tobing and Manurung <a href="#fn8" id="ref8">[8]</a> and Gervás <a href="#fn9" id="ref9">[9]</a> describe some of the most commonly used poetry generation approaches including template-based generation, stochastic language modeling, and evolutionary algorithms. 

##Sonnet Stanza Generation

###Data

Throughout this work, we use a corpus of sonnets written by Shakespeare <a href="#fn10" id="ref10">[10]</a> and other poets <a href="#fn11" id="ref11">[11]</a> to identify rhymes and train our language generation model. The corpus is 1.125 megabytes of data and includes 1,871 poems, which equates to 26,194 lines of poetry.

###Rhyme identification

To select rhyme pairs for the stanza, we investigated two approaches. The first approach uses Carnegie Mellon University’s pronunciation dictionary <a href="#fn12" id="ref12">[12]</a> (the Prondict) to detect rhymes in the corpus, based on phonemes, and infers additional rhymes given known rhyme schemes of sonnets (Inferring Rhymes). The second approach implements an unsupervised expectation maximization learning algorithm, as described by Sravana, R. and Knight, K., <a href="#fn13" id="ref13">[13]</a> to tag a poem with a particular rhyme scheme (EM Rhymes). In our poetry generation, we ultimately relied on the Inferring Rhymes approach.

Both approaches extend beyond simply looking up pronunciations in the Prondict, because (a) not all words are included in the Prondict, (b) the Prondict provides no understanding of words that poets typically rhyme together, and (c) the Prondict is limited in identifying non-true rhymes. <a href="#fn14" id="ref14">[14]</a>

####Approach 1: Inferring rhymes based on phonemes

In this approach, for each sonnet in the corpus, we begin by looking at the end words of each line. 

>**Example: end word extraction**<br />
>as one who pausing on the tedious slope<br />
>of some high mountain thoughtfully looks back<br />
>on the long painful and uncertain track<br />
>his feet have trodden then with awe and hope<br />
...<br />

>End words: [slope, back, track, hope, ...]

Using the Prondict, the last two phonemes of each end word are identified. If two words have the same last two phonemes, they are tagged as a rhyme pair. Over an entire sonnet, this results in an initial rhyme scheme. If an end word does not exist in the Prondict a rhyme is not identified and a ‘None’ is used as placeholder in the rhyme scheme. For example, a rhyme scheme may look like:

>**Example: initial rhyme scheme**

>[a, None, b, a, a, None, b, a, e, f, e, f, None, None]

Since the Shakespearean and Petrarchan rhyme schemes for sonnets are known, we can infer the complete rhyme scheme: 

>**Example: inferred rhyme scheme**

>Identified rhyme scheme using Prondict: [a, None, b, a, a, None, b, a, e, f, e, f, None, None]<br />
>Inferred rhyme scheme: [a, b, b, a, a, b, b, a, e, f, e, f, g, g]

For the sonnets written by Shakespeare, the rhyme scheme is set at [a, b, a, b, c, d, c, d, e, f, e, f, g, g], but in the other sonnets in our corpus the poets may take more liberty, which results in a variety of rhyme schemes. Following are examples of rhyme schemes that show this range of variation: [a, b, b, a, a, b, b, a, e, f, e, f, g, g] or [a, b, a, b, a, b, b, a, c, c, d, d, e, e].

As such, for the sonnets written by Shakespeare, regardless of how many end words are tagged as ‘None’, we are able to infer rhyme pairs. For the other sonnets, rhymes are inferred on a stanza-by-stanza basis by looking at lines 1-4, 5-8, and 9-14 in isolation. 

If a stanza has three or more end words that are unidentifiable using the Prondict, we elect not to infer rhymes from it. Similarly, in some cases in which a stanza has two unidentifiable end words, we are not able to confidently select the appropriate rhyme scheme, as seen in TABLE 1 (below). When only a single word in a four line stanza is unidentifiable, we are always able to confidently select a rhyme scheme. 


**TABLE 1**

| Partially identified rhyme scheme* | Feasible rhyme schemes       | Can we confidently infer rhymes? |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| [None, None, a, b]                 | [a, b, b, a] or [a, b, a, b] | No                               |
| [None, None, b, b]                 | [a, a, b, b]                 | Yes                              |
| [None, a, None, a]                 | [a, b, a, b]                 | Yes                              |
| [None, a, None, b]                 | [a, b, b, a] or [a, a, b, b] | No                               |
| [a, None, None, b]                 | [a, b, a, b] or [a, a, b, b] | No                               |
| [a, b, None, None]                 | [a, b, a, b] or [a, b, b, a] | No                               |
| [a, a, None, None]                 | [a, a, b, b]                 | Yes                              |
| [a, None, a, None]                 | [a, b, a, b]                 | Yes                              |
| [a, None, b, None]                 | [a, b, b, a] or [a, a, b, b] | No                               |
| [None, a, a, None]                 | [a, b, b, a]                 | Yes                              |
| [None, a, b, None]                 | [a, b, a, b] or [a, a, b, b] | No                               |


####Approach 2: Learning rhymes from unsupervised expectation maximization algorithm

Our second approach aims to extract rhymes based on the statistical closeness of words within stanzas without relying on the sounds of given words. We use an unsupervised expectation maximization learning algorithm to tag stanzas with their most likely rhyme scheme. This algorithm, developed by Sravana, R. and Knight, K., <a href="#fn15" id="ref15">[15]</a> is driven by the theory that if two end words co-occur in multiple n-line stanzas, then those two words are more likely to rhyme. 

>**Example: identifying word pairs with high rhyme strength**

>*4-line stanza*<br />
>as one who pausing on the tedious slope<br />
>of some high mountain thoughtfully looks back<br />
>on the long painful and uncertain track<br />
>his feet have trodden then with awe and hope<br />

>End words: [slope, back, track, hope]

>*4-line stanza*<br />
>out of the mistland of the past come back<br />
>and hold my hand in silence smile on me<br />
>just once to cheer me on the lonely track<br />
>that leads from sorrow to uncertainty<br />

>End words: [back, me, track, uncertainty]

In the above stanzas, the end words ‘back’ and ‘track’ would have a higher rhyme strength, because they co-occur in more than one stanza. 

####Selecting an approach

The Inferring Rhymes approach has perfect precision in identifying rhyme pairs because rhymes are only extracted if we are certain of the inferred rhyme scheme. Although, this means that this approach does not recall all of the rhyme pairs from the corpus. However, due to its probabilistic nature, with the EM Rhymes approach we cannot guarantee perfect precision, but we can achieve perfect recall. Thus, we elect to rely solely on the Inferring Rhymes approach because of its high level of precision as required in the rhyme bank creation. 

###Rhyme bank
We construct a rhyme bank by combining all of the rhyme pairs identified, based on their phonemes in the Prondict, into rhyme sets. To include words that are not in the Prondict vocabulary, we transitively add them to the rhyme sets. For example, if there is the phoneme sound (‘T’, ‘ER0’), it corresponds to the rhyme set [‘flatter’, ‘matter’, ‘character’]. With an inferred rhyme pair of (‘daughter’, ‘flatter’), we can transitively add ‘daughter’ to the rhyme set. 

Due to the transitivity, the cost of inaccurately inferring a rhyme is high. For example, if we incorrectly claim a rhyme, such as (‘day’, ‘flatter’), then when we create the rhyme dictionary, we will mistakenly create a rhyme set, such as [‘flatter’, ‘matter’, ‘character’, ‘daughter’, ‘day’]. Precision in rhyme pairs is vital, hence our selection of using the Inferring Rhymes approach.

The resulting rhyme bank has 344 rhyme sounds. Transitively adding words to the rhyme bank increases the size of the rhyme bank from 4,336 words to 8,265 words (a 90.6% increase). 

###Poem generation

####Building a line
We generate lines using a trigram language model trained on the sonnet corpora. <a href="#fn16" id="ref16">[16]</a> The lines are generated in reverse allowing us to initiate the line generation with a randomly selected word from the rhyme bank. We then build the lines backwards from the end word, stopping at ten syllables. <a href="#fn17" id="ref17">[17]</a>

After the randomly selected end word, the next word in the line is a weighted pick from all of the words that appear before that word in the corpus. After the last and penultimate words are selected, each subsequent word—moving backwards through the line—is selected by a weighted pick from words that precede the bigram in the corpus. The weights are determined by a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) that measures the count of the trigram in the corpus relative to the count of the bigram that follows it.

P(w_i  | w_(i-2),w_(i-1)) = count(w_(i-2),w_(i-1),w_i) / count(w_(i-2),w_(i-1))


####Implementing rhyme scheme

Currently we are able to generate poems in either a Shakespearean (a-b-a-b) or Petrarchan (a-b-b-a) rhyme scheme. In order to select our a and b rhymes for each poem, the poem generation function randomly selects two different lists of rhyming words from the rhyme bank. The end word for the first a line is randomly selected from the a rhyme list and used to generate the first line of the poem. The end word for the second line is randomly selected from the b rhyme list to generate the second line of the poem. For the third and fourth rhymes a word is selected that rhymes with the appropriate preceding line.

##Future Work and Conclusion

We are exploring various methods for creating semantic cohesion and enhancing figurative language across our stanzas in hopes of expanding to full sonnet generation. We also hope to ensure consistent pronouns across lines and add appropriate punctuation to simulate a more human-like poem.

Our aim with this work is not to claim that computers can replace human poets but rather to use natural language processing as a resource for both exploring the creative potential of the machine and reflecting on what is involved in human creative work.
