		<h1>About</h1>
	</div>
	<p class="letter">We created <em>The iSchool Review</em> for two main reasons. One was to showcase the best work from Schools of Information across the world&mdash;work that might otherwise never leave the confines of the classroom. The other was to address a question that tends to come up again and again about iSchools: "What is a school of information?" It's a tough one. So instead of providing a direct answer, we seek to empower our readers to formulate their own impressions by engaging with the original works in these issues.</p>

	<p class="letter">Each piece published was subject to a rigorous selection process overseen by the editorial board and advisory committee. Upon being selected, each work went through several rounds of back-and-forth edits. Then, each author, or group of authors, had to secure an endorsement from a faculty member at their affiliated academic institution; and while we acknowledge that the requirement to include a faculty endorsement might be a barrier that prevents some people from submitting, we think, given the early stage of this publication, it is crucial that each work is validated by a source beyond the editorial board.</p>
